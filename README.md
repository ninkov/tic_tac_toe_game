Tic-tac-toe is a fun game that you can play any time and anywhere as long as you have a piece of paper, a pencil, and an opponent. Tic-tac-toe is a zero-sum game, which means that if both players are playing their best, then neither player will win. However, if you learn how to play tic-tac-toe and master some simple strategies, then you'll be able to not only play but win the majority of the time. 

## Simple rules  "How to play the game"
Traditionally, the first player goes with "X", you can allow the first player to decide whether to go with "X"s or to go with "O"s. These symbols will be placed on the table, in an attempt to have three of them in a row. After the first player goes, then the second player should put down his symbol, which will be different from the symbol of the first player. The second player can either try to block the first player from creating a row of three or focus on creating their row of three. Ideally, the player can do both.
